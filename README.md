I'm currently working on learning as much about the cybersecurity world, networking, and informatin security as possible, as I build my skills and portfolio.
Last year I finished up a hands-on bootcamp course (Columbia Engineering's Cybersecurity Bootcamp), which not only went through the foundational concepts of cybersecurity and its frameworks, but also gave me keyboard practice with:
  VMs and hypervisor management
  Networking (both Linux and Windows)
  IAM and Active Directory
  Vulnerability scans and assessments (nmap, Nessus)
  Penetration Testing and reporting
  Splunk and SIEM training
  Mobile phone forensic analysis (Autopsy)
  2 CTFs
Now, I've continued to build on that knowledge, with practice in Python and scripting, SQL queries, NIST and ISO frameworks, and so much more.
